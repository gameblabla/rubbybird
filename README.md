==================
Rubby Bird (Android)
==================

Rubby Bird source code for Android, shipped with PixPlantilla (BennuGD, zlib).
I have decided to fully release the source code in order to (hopefully) allow the game to be released on F-Droid.
OUYA code was commented out and this version do not come with Admob. (It was using an old version that was no longer supported anyways)
