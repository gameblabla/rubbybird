Instructions here are for Windows.
Haven't switch to Linux yet.

You need the utils folder from pixplantilla.
Download pixplantilla here : http://www.pixjuegos.com/descargas/pixplantilla.rar

Put everything here in a new folder called "pixplantilla".
Move it to C:/

Install the Android SDK (Not Android Studio) : https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
Install API 16 and the sdk tools.

For the key, take a look at pixplantilla/bennugd-android/build.properties
Modify the file accordingly. (Change the key's alias to yours and change the key store directory)

Once everything is set up, simply compile the game with exportar-android.bat
If everything went well, you should end up with a new APK in pixplantilla->temp
